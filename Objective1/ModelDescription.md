The Perceptron is a fundamental machine learning model used for binary classification. It consists of a single-layer neural network with adjustable weights.
The model applies a weighted sum to input features and uses a step activation function to determine theoutput (0 or 1). It updates its weights iteratively 
based on the error in classification using asimple learning rule. The perceptron can effectively learn linearly separable functions butstruggles with 
non-linearly separable data. So this is all about the model.
